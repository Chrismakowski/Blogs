      <description>Hello, everyone. My name, as you probably were able to gather, is Chris Makowski and you must want to know something about me. Objectively speaking, I am a student athlete at Mercyhurst University, play Dividion 1 hockey and stufying both English and Communications. I run a blog on &amp;lsquo;blogger&amp;rsquo; entitled &amp;lsquo;Come and Share This Jam With Me,&amp;rsquo; and I also am a writer for the online magazine, &amp;lsquo;The Odyssey.&amp;rsquo;
My intention in this blog is to broaden my horizons in terms of studies and involvement, while also providing some quick and easy R tutorials.</description>
