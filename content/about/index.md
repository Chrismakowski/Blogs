Hello, everyone. My name, as you probably were able to gather, is Chris Makowski and you must want to know something about me. Objectively speaking, I am a student athlete at Mercyhurst University, play Division 1 hockey and stufying both English and Communications. I run a blog on 'blogger' entitled 'Come and Share This Jam With Me,' and I also am a writer for the online magazine, 'The Odyssey.'

My intention in this blog is to broaden my horizons in terms of studies and involvement, while also providing some quick and easy R tutorials. I hope you have fun with this blog, I know I will!
